Hello there, thanks for coming to my blog!

I am Ahmad Afnan Amjad from Lahore, Pakistan. Currently I am enrolled in a four-year BS program at the SBA School of Science and Engineering, LUMS University, Lahore. Initially I chose to major in Physics, but then I decided to switch to Computer Science. Right now I am in the process of switching my major.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:afnanmughal@hotmail.com) or [text me on WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=923235552888) (I'm not active on social media).

Thanks for reading!
