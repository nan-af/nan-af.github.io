Hello there, thanks for coming to my blog!

I am Ahmad Afnan Amjad from Lahore, Pakistan. Currently I am enrolled in a four-year BS program at the SBA School of Science and Engineering, LUMS University, Lahore. Initially I chose to major in Physics, but then I decided to switch to Computer Science. Right now I am in the process of switching my major.

This blog will contain whatever experiments or projects or remarkable observations or random insights that I want to write about. In other words, anything goes!

The name of this blog, nan-af is an anagram of my name, "Afnan" (that's what people mostly call me, not Ahmad, as many people would initially assume). One can also say that it is an abbreviation for "Not A Number, As F\*\*k" (that *is* true, is it not?). If you can come up with another cool interpretation, let me know :).

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to<!-- [drop me an email](mailto:afnanmughal@hotmail.com) -->
