Hello there, thanks for coming to my blog!

I am Ahmad Afnan Amjad from Lahore, Pakistan. Currently I am enrolled in a four-year BS program at the SBA School of Science and Engineering, LUMS University, Lahore. Initially I chose to major in Physics, but then I decided to switch to Computer Science.

This blog will contain whatever experiments or projects or remarkable observations or random insights that I want to write about. In other words, anything goes!

The name of this blog, nan-af is an anagram of my name, "Afnan" (that's what people mostly call me, not Ahmad, as many people would initially assume). One can also say that it is an abbreviation for "Not A Number, As F\*\*k" (that *is* true, is it not?). If you can come up with another cool interpretation, let me know :).

I like making new friends, so if you have any questions or suggestions, or if you just want to say 'hi', please feel free to get in touch via <span id="contact"/> <noscript><code>YOU NEED TO HAVE JAVASCRIPT ENABLED IN YOUR BROWSER TO VIEW MY CONTACT DETAILS. I'm sorry if this is affecting you, but I did this to keep spam away from my inbox</code></noscript> (I'm not active on social media).

<script language="Javascript" type="text/javascript">
    // Protection against spambots.
    // Probably a bit overkill, or maybe it's insufficient, IDK,
    // but it's definitely not the most straightforward way to do it.
    // I'm doing this because I really do not want to have
    // non-clickable contact details on my Blog.

    // Here I've replaced important information with the equivalent HTML ASCII codes.
    // it is split up into several parts,
    // and the parts are shuffled.
    // Automated tools that just look at the source code
    // will hopefully be unable to find my contact details.
    // But when the page is rendered, and this JavaScript code is executed,
    // everything comes out in perfect condition as clickable links.

    // I think this is pretty clever. I like it!
