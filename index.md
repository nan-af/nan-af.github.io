Hello there, thanks for coming to my blog!

I am Ahmad Afnan Amjad from Lahore, Pakistan. Currently I am enrolled in a four-year BS program at the SBA School of Science and Engineering, LUMS University, Lahore. Initially I chose to major in Physics, but then I decided to switch to Computer Science.

This blog will contain whatever experiments or projects or remarkable observations or random insights that I want to write about. In other words, anything goes!

The name of this blog, nan-af is an anagram of my name, "Afnan" (that's what people mostly call me, not Ahmad, as many people would initially assume). One can also say that it is an abbreviation for "Not A Number, As F\*\*k" (that *is* true, is it not?). If you can come up with another cool interpretation, let me know :).

I like making new friends, so if you have any questions, suggestions or corrections, or if you just want to say 'hi', please feel free to get in touch over <a id="email-link">email</a> or <a id="whatsapp-link">Whatsapp</a> (I'm not active on social media). <noscript><code>PLEASE ENABLE JAVASCRIPT IN YOUR BROWSER TO ACCESS MY CONTACT DETAILS. I'm sorry if this is affecting you, but I did this to keep spam away from my inbox.</code></noscript>

Thanks for reading!
