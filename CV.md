## Projects

### Multiplexing IoT Communication Protocols on a Single Radio
Contiki OS, C language

August 2020 - Present

I am currently involved in research with Dr Hamad Alizai where I am studying techniques to use a single radio to communicate with multiple IoT devices which may be using otherwise incompatible protocols.

### Distributed Greenhouse Monitoring and Control System
Contiki-NG, Tmote Sky, C language, Python, scikit-learn

July - August 2020

I developed an end-to-end system for monitoring and controlling a greenhouse system to achieve and maintain optimal plant growth conditions for my Introduction to Internet of Things course. A number of Tmote Sky devices were installed at different points in the greenhouse to collect environmental data and send it over to a server for processing. The server then sends commands to raise an alarm if any abnormal/hazardous conditions are detected. However, due to COVID-19, I was not able to physically implement the system on hardware and instead it was emulated in Cooja.

### Artificial Intelligence
January - May 2020

* __Neural Network for MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification__

    Python, NumPy

* __Genetic Algorithm maze solver__

    Python, Jupyter Notebook

* __Several other AI algorithms__

    Python, Google Colab, Pytorch

### Networks
January - May 2020

* __Peer-to-peer File Sharing System using a Distributed Hash Ring__

    Python

* __Implementation of Intra-Network Distance-Vector Routing Protocol__

    Python

* __Best-Effort Application Layer Packet Delivery Protocol over UDP__

    Python, Sockets

### Electronic Medical Record System
ReactJS, ExpressJS, PassportJS, OAuth, NodeJS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Heroku

January - May 2020

I was part of a team that developed and deployed an Electronic Medical Record system for use in a clinical setting, as part of our Software Engineering course. The project can be accessed at [e-m-r-s.herokuapp.com](https://e-m-r-s.herokuapp.com).

### Digital Logic Circuits
January - May 2020

* __Implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Fully Custom Logic Circuits__

    Logic Gates, Proteus Design Suite

* __State Machine for 12-bit Binary Sequence Interpretation__

    Logic Gates, 16 kB x 8 bit ROM IC, 6-bit Flip-Flop IC with common clock

### Tetris Clone
