## Projects

### Time and Motion Study Software
Laravel, PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, JavaScript \
October 2020 - Present

I am currently developing a software to aid in Time and Motion Study of industrial processes. It is intended to be used by industrial engineers who are working to optimise the assembly line for maximum speed.

### Distributed Greenhouse Monitoring and Control System
Contiki-NG, Tmote Sky, C language, Python, scikit-learn \
July - August 2020

I developed an end-to-end system for monitoring and controlling a greenhouse system to achieve and maintain optimal plant growth conditions for my Introduction to Internet of Things course. A number of Tmote Sky devices were installed at different points in the greenhouse to collect environmental data and send it over to a server for processing. The server then sends commands to raise an alarm if any abnormal/hazardous conditions are detected. However, due to COVID-19, I was not able to physically implement the system on hardware and instead it was emulated in Cooja.

I was part of a team that developed a fully functioning Autonomous Line Following Robot which also included a set of ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection for our introductory level Engineering Lab course. The task given to us was to navigate a maze in the shortest possible time. Our robot got first place in that competition.

### Website for Planned Event
HTML, CSS, cPanel \
Early 2016

I developed and deployed a fully functioning website for a planned event at my school, including a registration form.
